# ðŸ“±Personal Money Manager
## Description
In this project, I used the power of Google's Flutter framework to create a financial management tool. This application not only enables users to effortlessly store and categorize their income and expenses separately but also offers a personalized touch with customizable categories based on user preferences. Leveraging a local database, the app ensures secure and efficient data storage. By incorporating a note-like interface, users can intuitively record their financial activities. The added feature of customizable categories enhances user flexibility, allowing them to tailor the app to their unique financial habits.
